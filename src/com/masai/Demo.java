 Question No. 1 :- 
 
 
 Type casting is a way of converting data
  from one data type to another data type. 
  This process of data conversion is also 
  known as type conversion or type coercion. 
  In Java, we can cast both reference and primitive 
  data types. By using casting, data can not be
  changed but only the data type is changed.
  
  We have two type of typeCasting :- 
  1. Implicit typeCasting :- it change smaller data type value
                       into a bigger data type value;
                       
      Example :- int x= 20;
                 long y = 20;
                 
   2. Explicit typeCasting :- it change bigger data type value 
                        into a small data type value;
                        
 Example :- int =10;
            byte b = x; (it gives us error)
            
            byte b = byte(x);
